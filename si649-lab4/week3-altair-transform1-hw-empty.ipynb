    "## Overview \n",
    "We will work with a dataset from the article [\"Joining The Avengers Is As Deadly As Jumping Off A Four-Story Building\"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/avengers-death-comics-age-of-ultron/). We'll focus on **transformation**. In this lab, you will practice:\n",

    "1.   transform_calculation\n",
    "2.   transform_aggregate\n",
    "3.   transform_join_aggregate\n",
    "4.   transform_window\n",
    "5.   transform_filter\n",
    "5.   exporting to HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "The source data is available at this [link](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/avengers). You can also find a description of each column on the website. We preprocessed the dataset for you, and you do not need to write any data processing code. \n",
    "\n",
    "**For this lab, please write Altair code to answer the questions. In many situations, you could also solve the problem using Pandas. However, we want code that can be deployed without using pandas, so it's better to practice to just do as much as we can in Altair. You can complete the entire lab without writing any pandas transformation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "It's fine if your visualization looks slightly different from the example (e.g., getting 1.1 instead of 1.0, use orange instead of red)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lab Instructions (read the full version on the handout of the previous lab)\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Save, rename, and submit the ipynb file (use your uniqname in the name).\n",
    "*   Run every cell (do Runtime -> Restart and run all to make sure you have a clean working version), print to pdf, submit the pdf file. \n",
    "*   For each visualization, we will ask you to write down a \"Grammar of Graphics\" plan first (basically a description of what you'll code).\n",
    "*   If you end up stuck, show us your work by including links (URLs) that you have searched for. You'll get partial credit for showing your work in progress.\n",
