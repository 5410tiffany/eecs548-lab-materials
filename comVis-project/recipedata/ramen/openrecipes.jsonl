I used to call it my 'Million Dollar Salad' because buying the sesame seeds was so expensive. Now I buy the sesame seeds in bulk at a health food store and it's much more affordable.\"I have made this salad many times and it is a family favorite.  I cut oil down to 1/3 cup and use a 1/3 cup of Balsalmic vinegar.  I add chopped garlic, decrease sugar to 1/4 cup and add 5-6 packets of splenda.   This salad can also be made with Romaine lettuce and cranberries instead of cabbage for a little holiday flare.Good salad, a little sweet for my taste though.  I will definitely try it again, but will modify the amount of sugar.My whole family loves it!  Here are my modifications: I cut the sugar in 1/2.   My kids are not fans of onion so I omit them or put them on the side.  For a bit more flavor I like a bit of chopped fresh flat leaf parsley and shredded carrot(2T) which makes this salad even more vibrant looking.    A tip I'd like to share is to add about 1/2 tsp. sesame oil.  This gives a wonderful flavor.  The  dressing will  emulsify and not seperate once it's cold so chill it and whisk again before pouring on.   I like to pour the dressing about 15 minutes before eating or the ramen is too crunchy for me! :)I've added chunk cooked chicken breasts, Pinneapple and sometimes mandarin orangesMy mom used to make this when I was a kid. It is an awesome salad for either every day or to bring to a potluck.I emulsified the dressing so that it wouldn't separate overnight as I knew I'd be using the leftover dressing. Otherwise I followed the directions as written, only I keep the crunchy bits as a topping at the last minute instead of mixing in as we can't eat the whole salad in one sitting. Thanks for sharing your recipe!Great recipe.  Family loved it.  Making it again tonight.We are diabetic and looking for new and different recipes that can be tailored to our diet concerns.  I thought that I would try this one.  It was great.  I did have to make substations of course.  Splenda for the sugar and I did not use the raman noodles.  I did up the nuts a bit.  Hubby loved it and I may add more green onion.  Hubby wanted to try some chopped water chestnuts.  Thank you for sharing." }
