When cooking the noodles, cook them without the flavoring. During this time, (after you drain the ground beef) add the veggies to the meat and continue to cook. As the veggies become cooked, add the two packets of flavoring to the beef-veggie mixture. The ramen noodles don't take long to cook, so be sure to watch them. When they are done, drain them, and add them to the beef-veggie mixture. The completed dish will have more flavor, and more noodles for the noodle lovers! Enjoy!""

I was shocked to find that the first 2 ingredients in the seasoning packet of chicken-flavored instant ramen were salt and MSG, and that sodium listed in nutrition facts was for only half of the package.  So instead of 800 mg. of sodium, the package actually contained 1,600 mg.! MSG research on the National Library of Medicine database indicated MSG links to human diabetes, and there were dozens of MSG links to animal obesity and destruction of brain cells as well. The following recipe has no MSG in it and contains about 2/3 LESS sodium than commercial ramen packages.  While the flavor enhancer, MSG, and the large amounts of sodium are what make the packages of noodles taste so good, this version is a decent substitute that you won't be afraid to eat or serve people you care about.

Well...one day, I ran out of kimchi but was craving ramen.  After opening the fridge several times in hopes that I'll find some sort of kimchi hiding in some random spot, I saw the sriracha sauce and thought about making the onion dish.  The problem was that I didn't have lime...and I didn't have any jalapenos.  When I make something and find that I don't have an ingredient, I won't make it.  But since I remembered having it with just the onion and sriracha sauce long ago, I decided to just go for it.

Burdock root looks like a long parsnip but darker. It is known as gobo in Japan.   The taste is distinctive and can be found in many Japanese cooking.  When using burdock roots or gobo, it is best to soak in water after slicing or cutting with a bit of vinegar to keep from turning dark.  For substitution, I would use  carrot.  Konnyaku is made from konjac potato and is found in the refrigerated section of a Japanese or Asian market in a similar package as tofu.  It is normally whitish or brownish color and almost zero calorie and full of fiber.  Its texture is jelly like but more firm and needs to be quickly blanched in hot water for about 2 minutes before using.  If you cannot find it, just skip it since there is no substitution.  Although konnyaku does have flavor its own, it is most often used for texture more than flavor.  Mitsuba is an herb often used in soup dishes in Japan.  It is sometimes translated as trefoil and looks similar to parsley but the taste is totally different.  If you cannot find this, use some baby spinach. Other possibilites to add are anything seasonal vegetables such as asparagus, green beans, etc.  That's what makes sukiyaki like this your unique dish.  It can contain many things you prefer.  Keep all ingredients separate ie in one place when cooking without mixing them all up like stir fry.   Although traditional sukiyaki using the very best thinly sliced beef is wonderful, I really enjoy this method as well and it is more economical.  The use of gobo and ramen comes Harris Salat, but it's not in his Hotpot cookbook.","""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/40/17/47/picCUrGpM.jpg""",One Dish Meal,"c(""Chicken Thigh & Leg"", ""Chicken"", ""Poultry"", ""Vegetable"", ""Meat"", ""Japanese"", ""Asian"", ""< 30 Mins"")","c(""2"", ""1/2"", ""1/2"", ""1/2"", ""2"", ""2"", ""1"", ""2 -3"", ""8"", ""1"", ""1"", ""4"", ""1/2"", ""2"", ""2"")","c(""soy sauce"", ""mirin"", ""sake"", ""sugar"", ""carrots"", ""chicken legs"", ""shiitake mushrooms"", ""cake tofu"", ""scallions"", ""napa cabbage"")",NA,NA,916,40.4,13.1,69.3,4581.8,89.4,4.6,10.4,41.6,4,NA,"c(""To make the sukiyaki sauce:"", ""Combine all the ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil.

If  whole bamboo shoot is used, cut lengthwise into about 1/4 in slices first.  Then  cut into 1/4 inch slices.  Finally cut the 1/4 inch slices into half.  The slices do not need to be perfect - they will taste great when finished. You can also use canned bamboo as well (although taste will be not as good as the fresh version).   Menma is granddaddy of one of ramen toppings.  In old days if you ordered ramen in Tokyo this was always one of the toppings along with shoyu or soy sauce flavored soup. You can purchase this in a bottle commercially but the cost is quite high for a small bottle.   I like to sometimes serve this as a snack for beer, white wine or sake.

Saimin is basically the same thing as ramen, a Japanese noodle soup. In Hawaii, you will get the real thing, fresh, thin white noodles in a clear broth with green onions, kamaboko (fish cakes), and sometimes ham or char siu (pork). Some people add chicken, eggs, shrimp, and whatever else is desired. The Saimin is eaten very hot with chopsticks or spoons, and the broth is then drunk from the bowl.
